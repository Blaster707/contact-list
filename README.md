# Contact List Application

This application was created as a learning project to practice my skills in data and domain modeling, along with functional programming
and experimenting with JSON and HTTP.  The end goal was to have an application what would read and write to a file on disk.  To do so, 
I utilized JSON serialization and deserialization, and then interacted with application using HTTP via Postman.
